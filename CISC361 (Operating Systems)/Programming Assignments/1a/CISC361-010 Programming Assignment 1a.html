<h1> Programming Assignment 1a</h1>

<font size="+2"><b>C Programming</b></font>
</center>

<ol>

<li><b>Objective</b><br>

<p>
The primary objective of this assignment is to practice/review C
coding, including the use of C <b>structs</b> and <b>pointers</b>
for later use in the programming assignments.
</p>

</li><li><b>Details</b><br>

<p>
Write a C program that will allow the user to enter MP3 data 
into a <b>doubly linked list</b>, remove MP3 entries and view 
the contents of the list.
Your program will be graded based on its correctness,
code structure and documentation. 
</p>

<p>
You should have a <code>.h</code> file that declares function
prototypes, structs, etc.
Your <code>.c</code> file(s) should <code>#include</code> only
<code>.h</code> files and contain all the actual C code.
You need to make a C struct to hold information of an MP3.  In this
struct you should have:
</p><ul>
  <li> The name of the artist stored in a <code>char*</code> </li>
  <li> The title of the song stored in a <code>char*</code> </li>
  <li> The date that the song is from stored in a method of your 
       choice </li>
  <li> The run time in seconds stored as an <code>int</code> </li>
  <li> A "next" pointer to another one of these structs (so you
       can make a linked list) </li>
  <li> A "prev" pointer to another one of these structs (so you can
       make it a doubly linked list) </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
Once you have your struct, write a program to use it that will prompt
the user to (1) add an MP3 to the list, (2) delete MP3(s) from the
list, (3) print the list from beginning to end, (4) print the
list from end to beginning, and <font color="red">(5) exit the
program</font>.
When adding an MP3, your program prompts 
for each piece of information, and
adds the MP3 to the <b>end/tail</b> of the list.
When deleting, your program prompts for the name of the artist and
deletes <b>all</b> the entries with that artist.
When printing, start at one end of the list,
traverse and print each MP3 until reaching the other end.
<font color="red">When exiting the program,
free all dynamically allocated
memory to leave no memory leak</font>.
You may use <code>fgets()</code> to input character strings
(for artist name and song title)
as shown in <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/361/Proj_1a/fgets.c">this example</a>. Read the man
page of <code>fgets()</code> for details.
</p>

<p>
Your input and output should make sense to the user.  
</p>

<p>
Remember to always allocate memory for all your pointers to point at 
valid memory with <code>malloc()</code> or <code>calloc()</code>. 
Avoid trying to dereference NULL pointers which will result in 
segmentation faults unless you happen to get lucky!

</p>

</li>

<li><b>Makefile and Submission Instructions<br></b>

<p>You should create a makefile so that when TA types
   "<code>make mp3</code>", an executable named <code>mp3</code>
   is created. 

</p><p>
You should tar up your source code and the makefile, and
submit the resulting tar file so that your program can be
tested by TA. To do this, do the following.

</p><ul>
<li> In the current working directory, create a (sub-)directory 
     named <code>proj_1a</code> to store all your code
     and the makefile.

</li><li> <pre>tar cvf YourLastName_proj_1a.tar proj_1a</pre> 
</li></ul>

<p>
To verify that your files are in the tar file, take a look at the table 
of contents of the tar file like:
</p><ul>
<li> <pre>tar tvf YourLastName_proj_1a.tar</pre>
</li></ul>

<p>
Submit (upload) your tar file into Canvas. TAs will run your code
under Valgrind to check for any memory leak.
</p>

</li>

<li> <b>Sample code</b><br>

<p>
</p><ul>

</ul>

<p>

</p></li><li> <b>Notes</b><br>

<p>
Your MP3 C struct in Project 1a should look something like this.

</p><pre>typedef struct mp3 {
  char *name;
  struct mp3 *next;
} mp3_t;
</pre>

And, it should NEVER be something like the following.

<pre>typedef struct mp3 {
  char name[128];
  struct mp3 *next;
} mp3_t;
</pre>

Can you tell the difference? 

<p>
Try the following code on cisc361.acad to learn how
<code>fgets()</code> works, how to dynamically allocate memory
for each MP3 record, and how to dynamically allocate memory
for the "name" field within each MP3 record.

</p><p>
Run the code under <code>valgrind</code> to see if there is any memory
leak. (There shouldn't be.)

</p><pre>----------------- sample.c in 361/2019/Projects/1a ---------
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

#define BUFFERSIZE 128

typedef struct mp3 {
  char *name;
  struct mp3 *next;
} mp3_t;

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char  buffer[BUFFERSIZE];
  mp3_t *mp3;
  int   len;

  printf("Enter a name: ");
  if (fgets(buffer, BUFFERSIZE , stdin) != NULL)
  {
    len = (int) strlen(buffer);
    printf("length [%d] of string %s", len, buffer); // notice the length!
    buffer[len - 1] = '\0';                 // why minus 1 ???
    mp3 = (mp3_t *) malloc(sizeof(mp3_t));
    mp3-&gt;name = (char *) malloc(len);
    strcpy(mp3-&gt;name, buffer);
    printf("Name is [%s]...\n", mp3-&gt;name);
  }
  free(mp3-&gt;name);   // line free 1
  free(mp3);         // line free 2
  return 0;
}
-------------
</pre>

<p>
Now, try to comment out <code>line free 1</code> and/or
<code>line free 2</code>
to see if there are memory leaks under <code>valgrind</code>.
(There should be now.)

</p><p>
Also, can the order of <code>line free 1</code> and
<code>line free 2</code> be switched???

</p><p>
Here is an excerpt from the man page of <code>fgets()</code>.

</p><p>
"<code>fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream)</code> reads in at 
most one less than <code>size</code> characters
from <code>stream<code> and stores them into the buffer pointed
to by <code>s</code>. Reading
stops after an EOF or a <font color="blue">newline</font>.
<font color="red">If a newline is read, it is stored into the
buffer.</font> A terminating null byte (<code>'\0'</code>) is stored
after the last character in the buffer."

</code></code></p><p><code><code>
Try to comprehend it to understand why we need the "minus 1" in
<code>buffer[len - 1] = '\0';</code>
